        <h2 id="introduction">An image of your code is not helpful</h2>
        <p>When asking a question about a problem with code, people who are volunteering to help need the text of the
            code. Images of the code are not an acceptable substitute.</p>

        <p><img src="./assets/codeImage1.png" alt="Viewing the details of the exception"
                style="filter: invert(0);" F></p>

        <h2 id="whythisisaproblem">Why this is a problem</h2>
        <p>One of the first things answerers do when examining
            a question’s code for errors is to try compiling (if necessary) and running the code to see what happens.
            Answerers may also copy part of the code to paste into search engines in order to learn about the types or
            algorithms being used, and to find other related material. When answerers are presented only an image of
            code, this process becomes much more difficult.</p>

        <h2 id="whythisisworthadownvote">Why this is worth a downvote</h2>
        <p>It
            is important to finding fast, correct answers to provide everything needed by answerers in the question.
            When they are forced to <em>transcribe an image</em>, they are wasting valuable time that could be spent
            analyzing the problem. In addition, errors in the transcription make it less likely that a solution to the
            problem can be found. Image contents cannot be searched, so future developers with the same problem will be
            less likely to find this question. This is even more of a problem for developers who use screen readers, as
            they will neither be able to help answer the question or help themselves by finding the answer to their
            question here.</p>

        <h2 id="whattodonext">What to do next</h2>
        <p>Edit the question. Remove the images containing
            code from it. Copy and paste the text of the failing code into the question. It is very important that the
            code is the minimum needed to reproduce the problem, and that it is <a
                href="https://stackoverflow.com/help/formatting">well formatted</a>. If the code consists of HTML, CSS
            and JavaScript, <a
                href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2014/09/16/introducing-runnable-javascript-css-and-html-code-snippets/">stack
                snippets</a> can be taken advantage of to make the issue reproducible right in the question! This makes
            it much easier to see code problems and to provide fixes quickly.</p>

        <p>An example of well formatted code with comments explaining any issues:</p>

        <div class="highlighter-rouge">
            <div class="highlight">
                <pre class="highlight"><code>public static int Calculate(string digits)
{
  //Issue: x is 6 should be 5
  var x = digits.Where(char.IsDigit).Count();

  var sumOfDigits = digits.Where(char.IsDigit)
      .Reverse()
      .Select((e, i) =&gt; int.Parse(e.ToString()) * (i % 2 == 0 ? 1 : 2))
      .Sum(e =&gt; e / 10 + e % 10);
  //Error: sumOfDigits is returning 100 should be 600

  return sumOfDigits % 10;
}
</code></pre>
            </div>
        </div>
